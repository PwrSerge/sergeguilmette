Lynn presented "CBADDC" (Canine Behavior and Doggie Day Care) at the popular New England Pet Grooming Professionals (NEPGP) Summerfest in Warwick, RI on July 14, 2012. While attending and presenting, Lynn was taken by surprise to find out her clients, had voted her TOP DOG in NEPGP's annual contest (derived soley from client voting)! It was a great honor and testimonial to Wunderdog! Lynn wishes to THANK each and every one of her Wunderdog families for taking the time to vote and making her feel incredibly loved and valued!
