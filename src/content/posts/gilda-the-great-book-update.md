As most of our clients have already heard, Lynn and her daughter Laney (an artist/illustrator/animator/videographer) have started their first book about "Gilda," the sweet little character Laney rescued from a shelter out west. Laney has begun the illustrations, and we are hoping to complete the book in 2013.

The book will center around Gilda's start in her new life with "Ida Mae McDougal," a elderly ranch owner in Sante Fe, NM. Special little Gilda will be named "Gilda Rose McDougal" for unique reasons by Ida Mae. What is even more interesting is that the book is based on the true story of Gilda's rescue (a cause near-and-dear to all of our hearts!).

STAY TUNED for sneak peeks, pictures and progress-updates!
