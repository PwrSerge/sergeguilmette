Dogs of many sizes, shapes and personalities are available for purchase or adoption. The main thing that you, the potential owner, must recognize and understand, is that BEFORE you commit, you must have all the facts.

Do you want an athletic dog? A dog that is sedentary? A fast learner? A "vocal dog?" A friendly-to-all-people dog? A dog to alert you in the case of danger? What type of daily (or weekly) brushing or combing would you find reasonable? How much money are you willing to spend on routine supplies such as food or professional grooming? WHat about potential health issues common to a specific breed? Do you want a toy, small, medium, large, or giant breed?

Often following a movie that is based on a particular type dog, there is an increase in that breed's sales. Problem is, the people that want "a dog that looks like the cute character in the movie" don't understand the breed's traits or tendencies and how those may not "jive" with that person or their family. They just think the dog in the movie is cute, funny, or smart - and they want one just like it...

Even when adopting a dog from a shelter, it is important (when information is available) to understand the characteristics of the ALL the breeds that make up a "mixed breed." If you are not interested in a "vocal" dog, do not get a Beagle, a Norweigan Elkhound, or a Jack Russell Terrier! If you do not wish to be vacuuming daily, do not purchase a Siberian Husky, an Akita, a Golden Retriever, a PUG (not to mention the many short haired breeds such as Pointers or Labradors whose straight hairs are very stubborn about being removed from any carpet or fibrous surface)! If you cannot afford professional grooming, do not get a "hair-dog" that will require a professional grooming every 4 to 8 weeks (not to mention daily combing and brushing). You get the picture....

Wunderdog offers a "Breed Referral Service" that can take a lot of the hassle out of finding the right breed of dog for you and your family. Using this service can save you time and possible heartache often associated with making the wrong choices or a spontaneous purchase of a dog.

Call or email us today to find out how we can help you make the best decision possible about adding a four-footer to your family - whether purchasing a purebred dog, or adopting a rescue!﻿﻿﻿﻿

If you want to learn more about our daycamp program, go to the main menu and choose "Camp Wunderdog."﻿
What's so great about sending your dog to "daycare," or in Wunderdog's case, "daycamp"?

There are many reasons to do it, here are the TOP TEN:

1. It gives your dog (or puppy) socialization with other canines in a safe, relaxed setting (very important to a dog's happiness).
2. It offers you a "guilt-free" day knowing that your dog is having FUN, and being fulfilled.
3. Your daily training (manners, etc.) are reinforced in a positive way (all Wunderdogs have to sit at entrances and exits; they are taught to "wait," have group obedience, etc.)
4. Your dog will receive structure - something very important to a dog's piece-of-mind; we play HARD, but we positively reinforce "order" - for all our dog's safety and mental health.
5. If you have a puppy, and you need to work, your pup will be trained during your working hours! It costs about the same as having someone come into your home.
6. If your dog hasn't been properly socialized with people and/or other dogs, daycamp is one way to start acclimating him/her - this spills over to every day life!
7. Your dog will receive true cardio exercise; if you are looking to get your dog "fit," look no further!
8. Your dog will receive crate-time (short intervals) which reinforces the crate as a happy, safe-haven. Crating is a dog's "den," and should be a comfortable place for your dog to go to.
9. Daycamp is a great way for you to learn about your dog's innate behavior. It is good training for both owner and dog in the art of communication - your Wundercare giver will always lend an ear to you, and provide a voice for your dog.
10. Your dog will learn to trust other humans (outside of your "pack") - this is important for many reasons - but mainly for transitioning into different and necessary scenarios (examples: vet care, grooming, boarding, traveling, etc.). He/she will be exposed to many sounds and sights DIFFERENT from your home - again, this is great exposure for your dog!
